This app/automation script will help extract and summarize all necessary information with AI(ChatGPT4.0)to successfully invest in stocks.

Using JavaScript and Cypress for automation is a great choice, especially for testing web applications. Cypress is a next-generation front-end testing tool built for the modern web. It enables you to write end-to-end tests, integration tests, and unit tests. Here, I'll guide you through setting up a basic project to automate.

To create a similar app you will need VS Code And follow these instructions:

Step 1: Set Up Your Project First, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. If you haven't installed Node.js yet, download and install it from nodejs.org.

1.Next, create a new directory for your project and initialize a new Node.js project by running: 

mkdir cypress-automation 
cd cypress-automation 
npm init -y

Step 2: Install Cypress Install Cypress via npm:

npm install cypress --save-dev

This installs Cypress locally as a dev dependency for your project.

Step 3: Open Cypress After installing Cypress, you can open it for the first time by running:

npx cypress open

This command opens the Cypress Test Runner. The first time you run this command, Cypress will also scaffold out a cypress directory and populate it with example tests and supporting files.

Step 4: Write Your Test Create a new test file under **cypress/integration/stock_search_spec.js. **

Step 5: Run Your Test You can run your tests in two modes:

Interactive Mode: By running npx cypress open, navigating to your test file, and clicking on it. This will open a browser window where you can see your test running and interact with the application under test. Headless Mode: By running npx cypress run. This will execute your tests in a headless browser in the terminal.

Step 6: Add More Tests and Assertions Cypress provides a powerful set of commands for querying elements, interacting with the DOM, and asserting conditions. Explore the Cypress documentation to learn more about what you can do, and consider adding more tests and assertions to cover other scenarios and functionalities of the website you are testing.

Note: When automating actions on a real website, especially for testing purposes, always ensure you have permission to use automated scripts against it. Some websites have terms of service that forbid automated access or testing without explicit permission.

To work with Mocha testing framework, which Cypress supports. Here's how you can add mochawesome to your Cypress project for generating stylish test reports:

Step 1: Install Required Packages You need to install mochawesome along with a couple of additional packages to ensure compatibility with Cypress. Open your terminal and run the following command in your project directory:

npm install --save-dev mochawesome mochawesome-merge mochawesome-report-generator

This command installs mochawesome for generating the reports, mochawesome-merge for merging multiple report files into one, and mochawesome-report-generator for generating the HTML report.

Step 2: Configure Cypress to Use Mochawesome Edit your cypress.json configuration file to use mochawesome as the reporter. If you don't have a cypress.json file in your project root, create one. Then, add or update it with the following settings:

{ "reporter": "mochawesome", "reporterOptions": { "reportDir": "cypress/reports/mocha", "overwrite": false, "html": false, "json": true } }

This configuration tells Cypress to use mochawesome as its reporter and to output the reports in JSON format (which is necessary for merging and generating the final HTML report). The reports are saved in the cypress/reports/mocha directory.

Step 3: Add Scripts for Merging Reports and Generating HTML Report To merge the individual JSON reports into a single file and then generate an HTML report from it, add the following scripts to your package.json:

"scripts": { "cy:run": "cypress run", "report:merge": "mochawesome-merge cypress/reports/mocha/*.json > cypress/reports/report.json", "report:generate": "marge cypress/reports/report.json -f report -o cypress/reports", "report": "npm run report:merge && npm run report:generate" }

To enhance your Cypress tests with beautiful test reports, you can integrate mochawesome, a reporter designed to work with Mocha testing framework, which Cypress supports. Here's how you can add mochawesome to your Cypress project for generating stylish test reports:

Step 1: Install Required Packages You need to install mochawesome along with a couple of additional packages to ensure compatibility with Cypress. Open your terminal and run the following command in your project directory:

bash Copy code npm install --save-dev mochawesome mochawesome-merge mochawesome-report-generator This command installs mochawesome for generating the reports, mochawesome-merge for merging multiple report files into one, and mochawesome-report-generator for generating the HTML report.

Step 2: Configure Cypress to Use Mochawesome Edit your cypress.json configuration file to use mochawesome as the reporter. If you don't have a cypress.json file in your project root, create one. Then, add or update it with the following settings:

json Copy code { "reporter": "mochawesome", "reporterOptions": { "reportDir": "cypress/reports/mocha", "overwrite": false, "html": false, "json": true } } This configuration tells Cypress to use mochawesome as its reporter and to output the reports in JSON format (which is necessary for merging and generating the final HTML report). The reports are saved in the cypress/reports/mocha directory.

Step 3: Add Scripts for Merging Reports and Generating HTML Report To merge the individual JSON reports into a single file and then generate an HTML report from it, add the following scripts to your package.json:

json Copy code "scripts": { "cy:run": "cypress run", "report:merge": "mochawesome-merge cypress/reports/mocha/*.json > cypress/reports/report.json", "report:generate": "marge cypress/reports/report.json -f report -o cypress/reports", "report": "npm run report:merge && npm run report:generate" } Here's what each script does:

cy:run: Runs Cypress tests. report:merge: Merges all the JSON reports into one file. report:generate: Generates an HTML report from the merged JSON file. report: Combines merging and generating reports into one command for convenience.

Step 4: Run Tests and Generate Report Now you can run your tests and generate the report in two steps. First, run your tests:

npm run cy:run

After the tests have completed, generate the report:

npm run report

Your HTML report will be generated in the cypress/reports directory. Open the report.html file in a browser to view your stylish test report.

Note: Cypress outputs a lot of information in its test reports, and mochawesome provides a visually appealing way to review test results. Remember, the appearance and structure of your reports can be further customized according to your needs by adjusting the mochawesome and mochawesome-report-generator options in your configuration.
